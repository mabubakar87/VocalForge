# VocalForge

VocalForge is a Python-based application designed for real-time audio recording, transcription, and text formatting. It leverages the **Faster Whisper** model for accurate and fast transcription, and provides a user-friendly GUI built with **Tkinter**. The application supports both live audio recording and uploading of pre-recorded audio files for transcription. The transcribed text is automatically formatted and copied to the clipboard for easy use.

## Features

- **Real-Time Audio Recording**: Record audio directly from your microphone.
- **Audio Transcription**: Transcribe recorded or uploaded audio files using the Faster Whisper model.
- **Text Formatting**: Automatically format transcribed text for better readability (e.g., capitalization, punctuation spacing).
- **Clipboard Integration**: Copy the transcribed text to the clipboard for easy pasting into other applications.
- **Upload Audio Files**: Transcribe pre-recorded `.wav` files.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from multiple Whisper models (e.g., `distil-small.en`, `large-v3-turbo`) via a dropdown menu.
- **Custom Models Folder**: Models are stored locally in a `Models` folder next to the application for easy access and portability.
- **CUDA Support**: Utilize GPU acceleration (if available) for faster transcription.
- **Auto-Hiding Scrollbar**: The scrollbar in the text area hides when not needed, providing a cleaner UI.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and tracking application activity.

## Usage`:

1. **Recording Audio**:
   - Click the red circle button or press `Ctrl+Q` to start recording.
   - Speak into your microphone.
   - Click the button again or press `Ctrl+Q` to stop recording and begin transcription.

2. **Uploading Audio Files**:
   - Click the "Upload Audio File" button to select a `.wav` file for transcription.

3. **Selecting a Model**:
   - Use the dropdown menu to select a Whisper model (e.g., `distil-small.en`, `large-v3-turbo`).
   - The selected model will be loaded automatically.

4. **Viewing Transcription**:
   - The transcribed text will appear in the text box below the buttons.

5. **Copying Text**:
   - The transcribed text is automatically copied to the clipboard and can be pasted into any application.
   
## Model Selection

VocalForge allows you to choose from multiple Whisper models for transcription. The available models are:

- `distil-small.en`: Small English model (fastest).
- `distil-medium.en`: Medium English model (balanced speed and accuracy).
- `distil-large-v3`: Large multilingual model (high accuracy).
- `large-v3-turbo`: Optimized large model for speed and accuracy.

The models are stored in a `Models` folder next to the application, making it easy to manage and share.

## Logging

The application logs all activities to a file named `superwhisper.log` in the current working directory. Logs include timestamps, log levels, and messages.

## Notes

- **Internet Connection**: An internet connection is required for the first-time model download.
- **CUDA Support**: If a CUDA-compatible GPU is available, the application will automatically use it for faster transcription.
- **Audio Format**: Uploaded audio files must be in `.wav` format (mono, 16-bit, 16kHz).
- **Models Folder**: All models are stored in the `Models` folder next to the application. This folder is created automatically if it doesn‚Äôt exist.

## Troubleshooting

- **CUDA Not Available**: If CUDA is not available, the application will fall back to CPU processing, which may be slower.
- **Audio Recording Issues**: Ensure that your microphone is properly configured and accessible by the application.
- **Transcription Errors**: Check the log file for detailed error messages and ensure that the audio file is in the correct format.
- **Model Download Issues**: Ensure you have an active internet connection for the first-time model download.
